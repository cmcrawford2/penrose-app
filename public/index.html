      <h2>About Penrose Laboratory</h2>
      <p>
        Roger Penrose discovered a way to tile the infinite plane with
        pentagonal symmetry. The tiling can be expanded indefinitely, but it
        never repeats. The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling">
          Wikipedia article on Penrose tiles
        </a>
        is a good source of information. In my version, two diamonds are fitted
        together according to certain rules. These rules only allow eight
        different vertex configurations. After a tile is added, the code
        traverses the perimeter of the tiling, using a lookup table to find
        vertices that demand the addition of a specific tile. You can see how
        this works by disabling auto-fill and traversing the boundary one tile
        at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the properties of this way of tiling is that legal local
        modifications may create an illegal tiling at a distant location. You
        can see this effect by adding a narrow tile to the default white edge
        six times in a row. Then toggle auto-fill and force the program to
        traverse the perimeter until the flawed tiling is complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also create your own illegal tilings by disabling auto-fill and
        adding tiles one by one.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is the tiling displayed on an oscilloscope?</h2>
      <p>
        I built a computer using a Motorola 68008 microprocessor in Tom Hayes'
        digital electronics class at the Harvard Extension school (pictured
        below). Once I had the thing wired up properly, I programmed it in
        machine language to draw Penrose tiles on an oscilloscope, with a user
        interface consisting of the four buttons on the lower right. Later I
        refined the program using an assembly language interface that downloaded
        the code onto a RAM chip. The four buttons reset the display to a wide
        diamond, allowed the user to select an edge on the perimeter of the
        tiling, and added a wide or narrow diamond to the selected edge. Then
        the code filled in all the tiles that were determined by the rules. The
        program was basically a loop that drew a bunch of lines over and over,
        while the user buttons triggered interrupts and changed the data. My
        computer was so awesome that it achieved immortality, meaning I didn't
        have to disassemble it when the class was over.

        One of the best books I have ever read is
        <a href="https://secondkindofimpossible.org/">
          "The Second Kind of Impossible"
        </a>
        by Paul Steinhardt. He and others investigated the possibility of a
        physical crystalline structure based on Penrose tiles. The book
        describes how he and his collaborators then managed to actually find
        such a crystal in the far reaches of Siberia. Highly recommended.

        This program is written in React using the same algorithm as the one I
        wrote in machine language. Lines are drawn using the open source
        react-lineto package.
